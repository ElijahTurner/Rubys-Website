        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Someday-</strong> There's something missing There's something not quite right And I can feel it calling To me every night<br /> A little voice inside Tells me someone is out there And I must never give up Searching everywhere! (Someday)
            We are gonna be together (Someday) Life will be so much better (Someday) We will build a bond no one can break (Someday) <br />No more dark clouds above (Someday) United in the light of love (Someday) The story can only end one way We'll be
            together someday (Someday) We are gonna be together (Someday) Life will be so much better (Someday) We will build a bond no one can break (Someday) No more dark clouds above (Someday) United in the light of love (Someday) The story can only
            end one way We'll be together somedsay Someday! We'll be together someday!

            <strong>You Should Expect The Expected-</strong> You should expect the expected, and nothing more 'cause you've all heard this song and dance before! Our moves are stale, our harmony bland 'cause we're just another -- whoo! -- generic boy
            band! Yo, yo, yo! We're bringing it weak, and we're bringing it lame... <br /> Whatever we can do to keep it all the same! We're focus-tested, and radio-friendly! The only thing that matters is that we stay trendy! You should expect the expected,
            and nothing more 'cause you've all heard this song and dance before! Our phony-baloney image and brand 'cause we're just another -- Huh! -- generic boy band! Drop that generic phat beat! Ladies and... uh... ladies! Prepare for the bad boy
            musical stylings of... <br /> Dude-itude! You thought we'd never beat the fever but now we're here to make you believers! Sonic and crew, rockin' with the chemistry! Crummy boy band music is the enemy! We're here! We're Dude-itude! And though
            you may find us crude and rude, we have to conclude you'll come unglued now that you've heard us...

            <strong>Sunflower-</strong> Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh Ayy, ayy Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br />Needless to say, I keep her in check She was all bad-bad, nevertheless Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck Crash at my place, baby, you're
            a wreck Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check She was all bad-bad, nevertheless Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
            Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt <br />Ooh-ooh,<br /> some things you just can't refuse She wanna ride me like a cruise And I'm not tryna lose Then you're left in the dust Unless I stuck
            by ya You're a sunflower I think your love would be too much Or you'll be left in the dust Unless I stuck by ya You're the sunflower You're the sunflower Every time I'm leavin' on ya You don't make it easy, no, no Wish I could be there for
            ya Give me a reason to go Every time I'm walkin' out I can hear you tellin' me to turn around Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh I know you're scared of the unknown You don't wanna be alone
            I know I always come and go But it's out of my control And you'll be left in the dust Unless I stuck by ya You're a sunflower I think your love would be too much Or you'll be left in the dust Unless I stuck by ya You're the sunflower You're
            the sunflower Yeah.
